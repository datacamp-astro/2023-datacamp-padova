# SED and LC with gammapy

The purpose of this hands-on is to get familiar with `gammapy` and be able to perform a high-level analysis, which generally consists of reproducing a Sepctral Energy Distribution (SED) and a Light Curve (LC).

The former and the latter are essentially histograms in energy and time, respectively, where the Instrument Response Function (IRF) is properly taken into account. This means that the obtained histograms can be interpreted as the gamma-ray flux produced by the source under consideration.

## Requirements
* Basic packages: `astropy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, gammapy`

`gammapy` documentation: https://gammapy.org/
