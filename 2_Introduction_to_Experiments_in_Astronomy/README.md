# Introduction to Experiments in Astronomy

Gamma-ray astronomy is done through various class of instruments, sensitive in different ranges of the gamma-ray spectrum. In this presentation I focus mostly on pair-production satellite-borne instruments (such a Fermi-LAT) and ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (such as MAGIC). I mention quickly Shower Front Detectors while I skip coded-mask Compton satellites. I introduce the figure of merit of such instruments and some comparison.
