# Astrophysics Data Camp at University of Padova
The University of Padua keeps encouraging and renewing an internationalization strategy worldwide both to turn its degree programmes into open, innovative, and international learning environments and to boost its visibility, attractiveness and reputation for an increasingly better international ranking. Through the ‘Shaping a World-class University’ Project, the University aims to continue to support internationalization activities of different kinds.
In 2023, funds were granted to organize a school of gamma-ray astronomy and statistics for bachelor students in physics or astronomy from the Universities of Padova, Barcelona, and Bergen.
The duration of the school is 5 days, during which the students will learn basic concepts of high-energy astrophysics and statistical analysis with emphasis on hands-on exercises.

## International School Attendance
The school is meant for Bachelor students of Physics or Astronomy or similar degrees from the University of Padova, University of Bergen and Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. About 20 positions are available. For a limited number of non-Italian students, travel and lodging reimbursement will be granted. In order to apply to the school contact michele.doro@unipd.it or elisa.prandini@unipd.it

## Calendar and dates
25-29 September 2023 at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Padova

### Agenda
DAY 1 - Introduction to gamma-ray astronomy
DAY 2 - Introduction to statistics and data analysis
DAY 3 - Analysis of real data from current experiments
DAY 4 – Results interpretation
DAY 5 – Final discussion

# Working with this repository
This repository will host all the material for the schools, including lecture notes, basic python notebook tutorials and other relevant materials. All instructions to set up and use this page will be given in close distance from the school start. 


## Creating the environment to run the tutorials

Use mamba to create the environment for the school. The environment contains all the `agnpy` and `Gammapy` dependencies.

```shell
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

to run the notebooks remember to activate the environment

```shell
mamba activate datacamp-padova
```
